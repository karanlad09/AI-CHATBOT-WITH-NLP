## DESCRIPTION :

This Python-based AI Chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns and responses. It simulates basic human-like conversation using simple text matching and stemming techniques.

🧠 Features:
Processes and understands user input using NLTK's Porter Stemmer

Matches user intent based on keywords

Responds intelligently to:

👋 Greetings

❓ Questions

💬 Small Talk

👋 Farewells

Graceful fallback when input doesn't match known patterns

🔧 Technologies Used:
NLTK – For text preprocessing (stemming)

random – To return varied responses

data.py – Contains all training patterns and response categories

🗃️ File Structure:
main.py – Core chatbot logic

data.py – Dictionary with patterns and responses for each intent

🛠️ How It Works:
User input is tokenized and stemmed.

The bot checks which predefined intent the input matches.

A response is selected randomly from that intent's response list.

If no match is found, a default fallback message is shown.

📌 Example:

You: Hello  

Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

You: What’s your name?  

Chatbot: I'm just a friendly chatbot without a name! 😊
